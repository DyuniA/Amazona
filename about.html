HOBBIES?!?!?</h1>

<h3>VEXILLOLOGY?!?!</h3>

<p>For those who donâ€™t know, I am a big fan of Vexillology, the art of making flags.

I never make them physically, however, for I make them virtually, using the website <a href="https://flagmaker-print.com/">flagmaker-print.com</a>.

As displayed, I generally make alternate history flags and ideological flags, both non-historical.

All my works can be found <a href="flag catalog.html">here.</a>

<h3>GPOL!??!?!</h3>

<p> Alongside my interest in Vexillology, I like studying Political History and GeoPolitics., specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_history">Contemporary History.</a>

I consider myself pretty good at history and politics, atleast good enough to win the UN Quiz Bee 2023(ayoo!!).

Infact, did you know that I scored Champion there by about 12 points? Pretty cool! </p>

<h3>VIDEO GAME!?!?</h3>

<p>I both play and make video games as a hobby. I primarily play <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a> and Web Games, and I primarily make my games on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch,</a> with the stray experiment games on other platforms.

I like playing strategy and RTS games such as <a href="https://www.chess.com/">Chess.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/">Hearts of Iron 4.</a>

My games vary in style, but they are usually simplistic and depend on what my interest or hyperfixation was at the time.</p>
